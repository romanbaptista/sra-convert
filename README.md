# `sra-convert`

# Overview
This repository contains the sra-convert pipeline — a modular, HPC‑compatible workflow for:

> Converting .sra files into FASTQ format using a reproducible, restart‑safe, and parallelised SLURM execution model.

The pipeline is designed for execution in HPC environments and provides:
- Deterministic conversion of `.sra` files using a pinned SRA Toolkit version
- Parallel execution via SLURM array jobs for efficient large-scale processing
- Per‑accession isolation to ensure restart safety and prevent corruption
- Fully validated execution environment before any compute jobs are submitted

Internally, the pipeline follows a contract‑driven architecture, separating:
- configuration
- validation
- execution

to ensure reproducibility, portability, and fail‑fast behaviour across different cluster environments.

All outputs are written to a dedicated output/ directory, enabling seamless integration with downstream pipelines such as QC, trimming, or alignment.

# Workflow
At a high level, the pipeline proceeds as follows:

## Preflight validation
- Verifies required system binaries are available
- Confirms user configuration variables are defined and valid
- Validates pipeline scripts exist and are executable
- Checks input directory and accession file structure
- Installs and validates the SRA Toolkit (pinned version)
- Writes deterministic environment files for downstream execution
- Constructs an explicit execution ABI (`EXPORT_ARRAY`) for SLURM jobs

## Pipeline orchestration
Submits a SLURM orchestration job (`pipeline.sh`) from the login node

The orchestrator:
- Logs pipeline execution
- Submits a controller module (submit-array.sh)

## Array execution
`submit-array.sh` submits a SLURM job array:
- One array task per accession
- Concurrency limited by `SLURM_MAX_JOBS`

## Data conversion
Each SLURM array task (`sra-fastq.sh`):
- Resolves a single SRR accession from ACCESSION_FILE
- Loads the SRA Toolkit environment
- Converts `.sra` → FASTQ using fasterq-dump
- Writes outputs into accession-specific directories
- Compresses FASTQ files
- Skips completed accessions (restart-safe)

# Execution environment
- Preflight and orchestration execute on the login node
- Conversion runs on SLURM compute nodes
- Environment variables are explicitly passed via SBATCH_EXPORTS
- No implicit state is relied upon across execution boundaries

# Configuration
All user-defined parameters are located in `config.sh`.

At minimum, the pipeline requires:
```bash
INPUT_DIR="<path to SRA directory>"
ACCESSION_FILE="<file containing SRR IDs>"
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `INPUT_DIR` | Directory containing `.sra` files organised per accession (`${INPUT_DIR}/${SRR}/${SRR}.sra`). |
| `ACCESSION_FILE` | Plain-text file containing one SRR accession per line; ordering defines SLURM array indexing (`SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`). |
| `SLURM_MAX_JOBS` | Maximum number of concurrent SLURM array tasks (controls parallelism). |
| `FASTERQ_CPUS` | Number of CPU threads allocated per `fasterq-dump` task. |
| `FASTERQ_MEM_PER_CPU` | Memory allocated per CPU for each conversion task (passed to SLURM as `--mem-per-cpu`). |

# Usage
From the pipeline root directory:
```bash
bash sra-convert.sh
```

This will:
- Run full preflight validation
- Set up tool environments
- Submit the pipeline to SLURM
- Execute conversions in parallel via array jobs

# Outputs
All outputs are written to `output/` grouped by module.

Example structure:
```text
output/
└── sra-fastq/
    └── SRRXXXXXXXX/
        ├── SRRXXXXXXXX_1.fastq.gz
        ├── SRRXXXXXXXX_2.fastq.gz
        └── SRRXXXXXXXX.log
```

Each accession is isolated into its own directory, allowing:
- safe restarts
- parallel downstream processing
- deterministic outputs

# Why SRA Toolkit 2.10.9?
Many HPC systems provide an older SRA Toolkit module such as sra-tools-2.10.3.tcl.

While functional, these older builds often suffer from:
- Outdated HTTPS handling
- Unstable or inconsistent fasterq-dump behaviour
- Bugs in VDB configuration handling
- Reduced compatibility with newer SRA accessions

Version 2.10.9 includes important improvements:
- Improved stability and performance of fasterq-dump
- More reliable handling of large-scale conversions
- Better support for parallel HPC execution
- Reduced failure rates across batch workloads

For these reasons, the pipeline installs and uses a local copy of SRA Toolkit 2.10.9 by default, ensuring consistent and reproducible behaviour across different HPC environments.
